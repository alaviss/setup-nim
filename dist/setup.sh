Usage: $0 [option] version-branch

Downloads and install the latest Nim nightly for branch 'version-branch'.
The compiler can then be found in the 'bin' folder relative to the output
directory.

This script is tailored for CI use, as such it's very barebones and make
assumptions about the system such as having a working C compiler.

Options:
    -o dir     Set the output directory to 'dir'. The compiler will be
               extracted to this directory. Defaults to \$PWD/nim.
    -h         Print this help message.
